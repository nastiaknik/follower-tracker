Follower Tracker

1.  Show all - displays all tweets
2.  Show followed - displays tweets with status "Following"
3.  Show not followed - displays tweets with status "Follow"

4.  User Profile Page

The User Profile page displays additional information about a user and has a "Back" button that takes you back to the previous page.
