Follower Tracker

Follower Tracker is a web application that helps track the activity of Twitter users. The app has three routes:

1. Home Page

The Home page features two cards that show the most active user and the most popular user. These cards are designed with a stylish layout that includes a custom background image and a logoGoIT. The card's dimensions are adjustable based on the screen size, ensuring that the design remains responsive and user-friendly on all devices.
The cards' content includes the user's profile picture, username, and a brief overview of their activity or popularity on the platform.
The most active user card highlights the user who has the most tweets on the platform. The most popular user card highlights the user who has the most followers on the platform, indicating their significant influence and impact within the community.

Users can easily navigate to the Tweets page at the bottom of the page.

1.  Show all - displays all tweets
2.  Show followed - displays tweets with status "Following"
3.  Show not followed - displays tweets with status "Follow"

4.  User Profile Page

The User Profile page displays additional information about a user and has a "Back" button that takes you back to the previous page.
